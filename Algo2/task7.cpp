/*
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
 * for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to
 * identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 *
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences
 * (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 *
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
 *
 * No ocal tests provided. If you want to test go to
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/
 * and make your submission.
